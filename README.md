# 🚗 Car Price Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains an **end-to-end Machine Learning project** focused on predicting the resale price of used cars using historical automotive data. The project demonstrates a structured ML workflow including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

The project is designed to be **resume-ready**, **interview-friendly**, and **scalable for future enhancements**.

---

## Business Objective
- Predict car prices with high accuracy using regression models  
- Identify the most influential factors affecting resale value  
- Apply practical machine learning concepts to a real-world dataset  

---

## Repository Structure

Car-Price-Prediction/


├── Car Price Prediction.ipynb    # Complete ML pipeline

├── Car_data.csv # Dataset used for modeling

└── README.md # Project documentation



---

## Dataset Information
The dataset includes key car attributes such as:
- Year of manufacture
- Mileage / usage indicators
- Car brand and model details
- Selling price (target variable)

These features are used to train regression models capable of estimating market value effectively.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Scikit-Learn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## Machine Learning Workflow
1. Data Loading and Cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Engineering  
4. Model Training  
5. Model Evaluation and Performance Comparison

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Abhayvishe/Car-Price-Prediction.git

# Navigate to the project folder
cd Car-Price-Prediction

# Open the Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook "Car Price Prediction.ipynb"

# Exit bash (after closing Jupyter)
exit





----
### Key Outcomes
- **Developed a regression-based ML model for price prediction**

- **Gained insights into car valuation drivers**

- **Built a complete ML pipeline aligned with industry practices**


### Future Enhancements

- **Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI**

- **Add advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)**

- **Integrate feature importance analysis**

- **Automate model retraining**
